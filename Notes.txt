Sequence of events for adding new audio files to StompFish

1. Monitor watches a Directory
2. (User)Directory adds a new AudioFile
3. AudioFile moves to new Directory [ Metadata from AudioFile (*optional) ]
4. CatalogRecord creates a new instance of itself with Metadata from AudioFile

Monitor 
 -> can 'watch' a Directory
 -> trigger an event when Directory changes

Directory
 -> dirpath on the filesystem
 -> it can add new objects to itself, including AudioFiles

AudioFile
 -> a binary object that contains Metadata
 -> can relocate to a new Directory

Metadata
 -> filesystem information [ filename, filesize, file format ]
 -> audio properties [ duration, bit_rate ]
 -> audio tag attributes [ album, artist, genre, song title, track number, release date ]
 -> create it's internal state from an AudioFile

CatalogRecord
 -> a collection of objects in a relational database [ Artist, Album, Song, SongFile, Genre, ReleaseDate ]
 -> can create a collection of objects in a relational database from Metadata
